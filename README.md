Visual Odometry + Autonomous Car =>
The goal of the Visual Odometry project is to accurately estimate the motion of a robot using visual information from a camera mounted on the robot.
while the Autonomous Car project aims to develop a robot that can detect road lanes and autonomously navigate through them, as well as detect pedestrians and road signs using machine learning.
